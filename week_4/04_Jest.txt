JEST Framewor

It is javascript testing framework built by Meta often used for testing code

Jest also supports code coverage. Code coverage is a measure of 
what percentage of my code is covered by tests.

Mocking allows you to separate the code that you are testing from it's related dependencies.
In other words, you can use the mocking features to make sure that your unit testing is stand-alone.

it allows the front-end developers to finish their site of the new feature independently. 
In certain cases, developers can use mocking to ship features faster. 

In Jest you use mocking by employing Jest mock functions. 
It's also easy to test asynchronous code in Jest.


Finally, Jest allows you to perform snapshot testing. 
Snapshot testing is used by developers to verify that 
there are no regressions in the DOM of our apps 
after some changes to the code base are made.
