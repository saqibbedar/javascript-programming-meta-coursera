Testing is a piece of software at a high level means making sure that it behaves 
as expected in any modern software development project. 
These expectations are recorded as software requirements.

There are different kinds of testing.
1. e2e testing
2. Integration testing
3. Unit testing




1. e2e testing:
You test your product/app/software as being user to see everything is working perfect. 
In other words, you're testing the entire finished software product from the perspective 
of the end user. Now here's something you may find interesting. 
The person testing the app doesn't have to be a developer.


E two E tests are the slowest and take the most time to set up and run. 
Here are a few examples of eat away testing frameworks available on the market.

Web driver Js Protractor and Cyprus.


2. Integration testing:
Integration testing is testing how parts of your system interact with other parts of your system. 
In other words, it's testing how separate parts of your apps work together.

et's explore two examples of integration testing software react testing, 
library and enzyme integration tests are faster and cheaper than 
E two E tests but not as fast or as cheap as unit testing.




3. Unit testing:
Unit testing is the process of testing the smallest units of your source code in isolation. 
A good example of this is functions. 
A unit is the smallest piece of code that you can test separately from the rest of the app.


Practically the smallest unit of testable code in Js is usually a function or a method. 
Unit tests are self contained. They're meant to test code in isolation, 
preferably separate from the rest of your app. 
This makes unit tests fast to run and easy to write.
