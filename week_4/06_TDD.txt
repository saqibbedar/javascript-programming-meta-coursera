// TDD (Test-Driven Development)
// is a streamed lined process of writing code that will satify some requierments

//  it's important to note that one of the rules of TDD is that you should write as 
little code as possible to make the test pass for this test to pass,

TDD brings huge benefits to an organization because it allows for automated testing in 
any platform projects grow bigger over time and become complex.

with TDD, you are minimizing regressions that is accidental bugs introduced to old code 
by coding a new requirement and you also have proof that your new implementation 
is not breaking other parts of the app.
