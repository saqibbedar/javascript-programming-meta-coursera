The 'keydown' and 'keyup' events in JavaScript are similar in that they both respond to keyboard inputs, but they are triggered at different times and can therefore have different uses.

The 'keydown' event is fired as soon as a key is pressed down. If you hold down a key, 'keydown' will fire once immediately, and then start repeating after a short delay. This can be useful for actions that should start immediately when a key is pressed and potentially repeat if the key is held down, like moving a character in a game.

On the other hand, the 'keyup' event is fired when a key is released. This event will only fire once for each key press, no matter how long the key is held down. This can be useful for actions that should only happen once per key press, regardless of how long the key is held down, like submitting a form when the Enter key is released.

Here's a simple example to illustrate the difference:

```javascript
let keydownCount = 0;
let keyupCount = 0;

window.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => {
    keydownCount++;
    console.log(`Keydown count: ${keydownCount}`);
});

window.addEventListener('keyup', (event) => {
    keyupCount++;
    console.log(`Keyup count: ${keyupCount}`);
});
```

If you run this code and press and hold a key, you'll see the 'keydown' count increase rapidly, while the 'keyup' count only increases once you release the key.
