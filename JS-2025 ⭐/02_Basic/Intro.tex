// JavaScript is a interpreted language, which means code would be executed even if there is a error.

// Interpreted language: A language thats code is executed line by line is called interpreted language. Code would be executed even if there is there is an error. If line one is executed and there is error on line 2 so code would stop at line 2 due to error but earlier code executed because of interpreted language.

Example: 
console.log("Hello");
console.log(hey);
console.log("hello");

// Output:
// Hello
// ReferenceError: hey is not defined
// further code will not be executed due to error


// Compiled language: A language thats code is Compiled before its execution is called a compiled language. And if code has any error then it won't be executed as it has been compiled first so it won't be executed with an error.

// Example of compiled language: c++ language
