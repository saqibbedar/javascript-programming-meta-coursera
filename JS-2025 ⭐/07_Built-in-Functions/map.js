// To make a new Map, you can use the Map constructor:

new Map();

let bestBoxers = new Map();
bestBoxers.set(1, "The Champion");
bestBoxers.set(2, "The Runner-up");
bestBoxers.set(3, "The third place");

console.log(bestBoxers);

// Output:
/* Map(3)Â {
    1 => 'The Champion', 
    2 => 'The Runner-up', 
    3 => 'The third place'
 }*/

// To get a specific value, you need to use the get() method. For example:  
bestBoxers.get(1); // 'The Champion'
