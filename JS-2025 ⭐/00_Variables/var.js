// creating variables with var: 

// var is an keyword in javascript that is used to create a variables.

var x = 10; // x is a variable and 10 is a value assigned to x.
var b = 5; // b is a variable and 5 is a value assigned to it.

// In same way we can create as many as variables we want

// Now how can we see if x has 10 value, to see that we will use a function console.log() to print the value in our program.

console.log(x);
