// variables are used to store the data, they are just like a containers in which we have to store the data and use it for specific tasks.

for example I have x variable which is equal to 10, it means x has 10 value or in other words x is assigned 10 so x is a variable that is holding data value of 10. In programming we can write it as follows

x = 10

now x is assigned with 10 so it is stored with a value 10 inside it.
