Word vs Keyword 

Anything that javascript does not know is a word in js and anything that js knows is a keyword.

For example: 
    saqib
    bedar 
    is 
    a
    good
    programmer
    etc // all are words because js don't know what are these

    if 
    else
    var
    let
    function
    etc // are keyword because they have a meaning in javascript
