Comments in JavaScript

There are two types of comments in JavaScript:
   
    1. Single line comment (Syntax of single line comment is // double slash.)
    A single comment created when you add two forwarded-slash characters one after the other, without spaces.

    2. Multi-line comment (Syntax of Multi-line comment is /*  */)
    It is created with a forwarded slash and a star.

Why do we write comments?
    
1. Comments are ingnored by the browser, so we can express our ideas about any code that we write. 
2. We can add comments to any code that already exists.
3. Those comments can be useful to us in future, and it also helps your teammates.

Inshort, comments do play a vital role in programming because comments facilate the communication.
