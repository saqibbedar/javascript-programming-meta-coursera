// Semi-colon in JavaScript

/*  Semi-colon ";" used to delimit parts of the code from other parts of the code.
    Semi-colon is same like full stop "." in English language that seprate the thoughts into sentences.
*/

/*  However, semi-colons are optional to use, 
because browser will automatically fill the blanks, but it is good to use semi-colon to make your code more readable.
*/
console.log("Hello World");

// In our first lesson, we don't use semi-colon but we get the "Hello World" value printed in the terminal.
// However, we use it here, it will still print the same value in the termianl.
// Point to note here is, it is up to us wether we use it or not, because browser will automatically detect it.
