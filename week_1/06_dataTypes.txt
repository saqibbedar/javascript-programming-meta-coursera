*** Data types in JavaScript

What are data types?
Data types are the ways to store the data in diffrent ways, it can be numbers, strings, Boolean and more.
There are 7 primitive data types in JavaScript, they are as follows;

1. String: Store the values such as titles
2. Numbers: Store numbers for calculations, pricing etc.
3. Boolean: It has only two values true or false. It helps you in desicion making.
4. Null: It has no value or it represnts the absense of value.
5. Undefined: It refers to the those variables which are not been assinged yet.
6. BigInt: an extra large box that can accommodate a much greater range of numbers than the number data type.
7. Symbol: it can be used as a unique identifier.

Note: We have used these types in our previous expamles. Mostly, as a beginner programmer you will encounter with the first four data types. However, it is better to know all the types.
