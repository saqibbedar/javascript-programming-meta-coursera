// A bug causes a program to run in an unintended way
// Error causes to stop running our code

// let's try a bug in our program
function addTwoNums (a, b) {
  console.log(a+b);
}
addTwoNums('1', 4) // we can use concat method to add them but we are testing a bug
console.log('Code is still running'); // JS will handle this bug happily

// The above program is not working as intended

// let's try an error
console.log(x, z); // The code will through an error & program would be stoped to run
console("The above will never run")

// An error can be defined as a faulty piece of code that prevents the program from further execution

// Error types

/* 
  1. Reference error - we got above (undefined values)
  2. Syntax error - error in the structure of code 
  3. Type error - mixing the things
