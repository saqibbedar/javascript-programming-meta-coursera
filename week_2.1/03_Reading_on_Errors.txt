Most common errors in JavaScript: 

ReferenceError 
SyntaxError 
TypeError 
RangeError

There are some other errors in JavaScript. These other errors include: 

AggregateError 
Error 
InternalError 
URIError

1. ReferenceError:
A ReferenceError gets thrown when, for example, 
one tries to use variables that haven't been declared anywhere.
Example: console.log(username)

2. SyntaxError:
Any kind of invalid JavaScript code will cause a SyntaxError.
Example: var a "there's no assignment operator here";

3. TypeError:
 TypeError is thrown when, for example, 
 trying to run a method on a non-supported data type.
 Example: "hello".pop() 

 4. RangeError:
RangeError is thrown when we're giving a value to a function, 
but that value is out of the allowed range of acceptable input values.
Example: (10).toString(100); // Uncaught RangeError: toString() radix argument must be between 2 and 36

if I try to use a non-existing number system, 
such as an imaginary Base 100, 
since this number system effectively doesn't exist in JavaScript, 
I will get the RangeError, 
because a non-existing Base 100 system is out of range of the number systems 
that are available to the toString() method:
