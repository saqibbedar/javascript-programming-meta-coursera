let letters = 'abc';
letters.match(/a/) // this will return several piece of information in array
// but it will confirm that a was found in the list 

// let's try a different letter

letters.match(/d/) // here null will appear as d doesnot found to indicate the absense of object

// undefined 
console.log('john simth') // this will through error undefined because because console.log is a function and you are not returning a value.

// the undefined datatype acts like a placeholder for a value that the JavaScript engine knows to exist. It just has not been specified.

// Empty Strings 
// Srings that are with blank values or no values

console.log("") // this will show an empty place
